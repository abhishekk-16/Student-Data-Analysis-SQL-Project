# Student-Data-Analysis-SQL-Project

## PROJECT OVERVIEW:

This project is designed to demonstrate SQL skills and techniques typically used by data analysts to explore, clean, and analyse student data. The project involves setting up a student database, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), and answering specific questions through SQL queries. 

## OBJECTIVES:

1. **Set up a student database**: Creating and populating a student database with the provided student data.
2. **Data cleaning**: Identifying and removing any records with missing or null values.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Performing basic EDA to understand the dataset.
4. **Data Analysis**: using SQL to answer specific questions and derive insights from the student data.

## PROJECT STRUCTURE:

### 1. Database Setup

   - **Database creation**: Project starts by creating a database named `student_project_db` .
   - **Table creation**: A table named `student_data` is created to store the student data.

```sql
CREATE DATABASE student_project_db;

CREATE TABLE student_data
(
      student_id VARCHAR(20) PRIMARY KEY,
      first_name VARCHAR(50),
      last_name VARCHAR(50),
      email VARCHAR(50),
      gender VARCHAR(10),
      age INT,
      department VARCHAR(20),
      attendance DOUBLE,
      midterm_score DOUBLE,
      final_score DOUBLE,
      assignment_avg DOUBLE,
      quizzes_avg DOUBLE,
      participation_score DOUBLE,
      project_score DOUBLE,
      total_score DOUBLE,
      grade VARCHAR(10),
      study_hours_per_week DOUBLE,
      extracurricular_activities VARCHAR(10),
      internet_access_at_home VARCHAR(10),
      parent_education_level VARCHAR(50),
      family_income_level VARCHAR(10),
      stress_level INT,
      sleep_hours_per_night DOUBLE
);
```

### 2. Data Exploration and Cleaning

- **Record Count**: Determining the total number of record in dataset.
- **Null Value Check**: Checking for any null values in dataset and creating two tables `student_data_valid` for records without any null values and `student_data_invalid` for records having null values.

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM student_data ;

-- Finding records with any null values
SELECT * 
FROM student_data
WHERE
    student_id IS NOT NULL
    AND 
    first_name IS NOT NULL

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM student_data_invalid;
```

### 3. Data Analysis & Findings

The following SQL queries are developed to answer specific question:

1. **SQL query to find total student in each department (valid & invalid data both)**:

```sql
SELECT
     department,
     COUNT(*) AS total_student 
FROM student_data_valid
GROUP BY department
order BY total_student DESC;

SELECT
     department,
     COUNT(*) AS total_student 
FROM student_data_invalid
GROUP BY department
order BY total_student DESC;
```
2. **SQL query to find out total student gender wise in each department**:

```sql
SELECT
      department,
      gender,
      COUNT(*) AS total_student
FROM student_data_valid
GROUP BY department, gender
ORDER BY department;
```
3. **SQL query to find top 5 rank holders of each dept gender wise**:

```sql

        first_name,
        last_name,
        gender,
        department,
        total_score,
        rank() OVER(PARTITION BY department, gender 
                    ORDER BY total_score desc )
         AS rank_in_dept
      FROM student_data_valid
)
SELECT *
FROM department_toppers
WHERE rank_in_dept BETWEEN 1 AND 5 
ORDER BY department; 
```

4. **SQL query for finding students with attendance lower than 60% dept wise**:

```sql

      first_name,
      last_name,
      gender,
      email,
      attendance
FROM student_data_valid
WHERE attendance < 60
ORDER BY department, attendance ASC ;

SELECT 
      department,
      COUNT(*) AS low_attendance_students
FROM student_data_valid
WHERE attendance < 60
GROUP BY department
ORDER BY low_attendance_students DESC;
```

5. **SQL query to generate attendance warning list of CS dept**:

```sql
SELECT 
      student_id,
      CONCAT(first_name, ' ', last_name) AS full_name,
      department,
      email,
      attendance,
      case
          when attendance < 55 then 'Critical warning'
          when attendance < 65 then 'Warning'
          
      END AS attendance_status
FROM student_data_valid
WHERE department = 'CS' AND attendance < 65
ORDER BY attendance;
```

6. **SQL query for updating grades according to total marks**:

```sql
UPDATE student_data_valid
SET grade = case
    when total_score >= 90 then 'A'
    when total_score >= 80 then 'B'
    when total_score >= 70 then 'C'
    when total_score >= 60 then 'D'
    ELSE 'F'
END ;
```

7. **SQL query to find student performance overview**:

```sql
SELECT
      student_id,
      CONCAT( first_name , ' ', last_name ) AS full_name,
      department,
      total_score,
      grade,
      attendance
FROM student_data_valid
ORDER BY total_score DESC ;
```

8. **SQL query to find dept wise performance analysis**:

```sql
SELECT
      department,
      COUNT(*) AS total_student,
      ROUND(AVG(total_score), 2) AS avg_score,
      ROUND(AVG(attendance), 2) AS avg_attendance,
      ROUND(AVG(study_hours_per_week), 2) AS avg_study_hours
FROM student_data_valid
GROUP BY department
ORDER BY avg_score DESC ;
```

9. **SQL query to find stress level corelation**:

```sql
SELECT
      stress_level,
      COUNT(*) AS total_students,
      ROUND(AVG(total_score), 2) AS avg_score,
      ROUND(AVG(sleep_hours_per_night), 2) AS avg_sleep_hours,

FROM student_data_valid
GROUP BY stress_level
ORDER BY stress_level ;
```

10. **SQL query to find avg marks of students department wise with internet access and no access at home**:

```sql
